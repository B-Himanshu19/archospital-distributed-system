# ArcHospital 🏥 — Distributed Healthcare Backend System

ArcHospital is a distributed backend healthcare management system that handles doctor👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️, patient🧑, appointments 📅, and medical record data📝 in a hospital environment. The architecture focuses on modular microservices, scalable data pipelines, and backend-driven automation suitable for large-scale healthcare or insurance platforms.🚀


## Features 🌟

- **Doctor Microservice**: Add 👥, view 👀, and delete ❌ doctor profiles with their specialties, availability and contact information.
- **Patient Microservice**: Maintain a database of patients 🧑and retrieve patient personal details and medical histories. 📂
- **Appointment Scheduling Engine**: Backend-driven scheduling appointments 📆 by assigning doctors to patients based on availability and specialties.
- **Medical Records Storage**:Secure Storage 💾 and retrieve 📥of detailed medical patient records for each patient. Secure storage & retrieval of patient diagnosis, treatment plans, and reports.
- **Automatic Appointment Assignment**: Leverage an intelligent algorithm 🤖 to automatically assign appointments based on doctor specialties and patient medical histories.

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/archospital-distributed-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hospital-management-system
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the SQLite database:

```bash
python
>>> import sqlite3
>>> conn = sqlite3.connect('archospital.db')
>>> conn.close()
```

5. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage 🧑‍💻

1. **Homepage**: The landing page provides an overview of the Hospital Management System. 🏠
2. **Doctors**: Access the list of registered doctors 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️. You can add new doctors 👥, view their details 👀, and delete existing ones ❌.
3. **Patients**: Manage the patient database 🧑. Add new patients 👥, view their medical histories 📜, and remove existing patients ❌.
4. **Appointments**: Schedule appointments 📅 by assigning doctors to patients based on availability and specialties,through the backend engine and that assigns doctors to patients automatically based on real-time availability and specialty matching.. View the list of scheduled appointments 📋, and delete appointments if needed ❌.
5. **Auto-Assign Appointments**: Use the intelligent algorithm 🤖 to automatically assign appointments based on doctor specialties and patient medical histories.

## Backend Architecture 🏗️

- **Stateless Microservices**: Each module handles independent functionality.
- **SQLite Backend**: Lightweight database for demo purposes; adaptable to full-scale SQL or NoSQL solutions.
- **RESTful APIs**: Clean separation of frontend/backend communication.
- **Scalable Design**: Ready for deployment via Docker/Kubernetes clusters.
- **Secure Data Flow**: End-to-end encryption for patient confidentiality and HIPAA-compliant design.
- **Distributed Ready**: Capable of multi-region deployment across data centers.
